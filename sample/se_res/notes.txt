synchronous rotation is ~ 24.8364706645 radians per year for this case
2.1 = 52.15658839545


figure out units for inertia tensor: seem to be M_sun * AU ^2

"The Q coefficient in the tidal model can then be calculated (k2 = Q/(1 âˆ’ Q))" -- from implementation paper
k2 = 1.5 (we used) --> Q = 1.5/2.5 = 0.6
